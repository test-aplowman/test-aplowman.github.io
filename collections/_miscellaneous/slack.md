Here is a quick summary of how to use Slack's video conferencing in our weekly progress meetings. Full instructions can be found [here](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/216771908).


## Instructions for attendees

1. Select the channel in which the call has started
2. Select `Join this call`

## Instructions for chairpersons

For screen sharing, you will need to [download](https://slack.com/downloads) the Slack desktop app, rather than use the web app.

1. Select the channel in which you would like to start the call
2. Select the phone icon
3. Select `Start new call`
